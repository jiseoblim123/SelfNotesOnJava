So in sorted arrays, you can look for indexes of numbers in array by using binarySearch().
The rule for this is that the array should be sorted.
If it's not found in the array set, the number will turn negative.

For example,
int[] numbers2 = {2,4,6,8};
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers2, 4)); //looking for index of 4
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers2, 3));

prints:
1
-2

The -2 in this case is because the number 3 is not in array set so it becomes -3 then you subtract -1 because indexes start from 0.
binarySearch() can be useful in situations where you are playing a number game and you are figuring out the number that is missing.
You can set up a loop to go through all the indexes and print each time the index by binarySearch() and see when it turns negative.
