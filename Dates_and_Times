Let's talk about creating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times.

Three types of Date and Time:
1. LocalDate: this is just date like your birthday -- no time, no time zone.
2. LocalTime: Contains just a time -- no date, no time zone. Example: Midnight
3. LocalDateTime: Contains both date and time, but no time zone. Example: Midnight of New Year's

System.out.println(LocalDate.now());
System.out.println(LocalTime.now());
System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now());

each printed at January 20 at 12:45 p.m.:
2015-01-20
12:45:18.401
2015-01-20T12:45:18.401

Now that you know how to create the current date and time, let’s look at other specifi c
dates and times. To begin, let’s create just a date with no time. Both of these examples
create the same date:
LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(2015, Month.JANUARY, 20);
LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.of(2015, 1, 20); // Java counts 1 as January not 0 for LocalDate, so no worries.

When creating a time, you can choose how detailed you want to be. You can specify just
the hour and minute, or you can add the number of seconds. You can even add nanoseconds
if you want to be very precise. (A nanosecond is a billionth of a second—you probably
won’t need to be that specifi c.)
LocalTime time1 = LocalTime.of(6, 15); // hour and minute
LocalTime time2 = LocalTime.of(6, 15, 30); // + seconds
LocalTime time3 = LocalTime.of(6, 15, 30, 200); // + nanoseconds

Finally, we can combine dates and times:
Example:
LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(2019, Month.April, 20);
LocalTime time1 = LocalTime.of(9, 10, 30);
LocalDateTime dateTime2 = LocalDateTime.of(date1, time2);


**
Did you notice that we did not use a constructor in any of the examples? The date and
time classes have private constructors to force you to use the static methods.
So..
LocalDate d = new LocalDate(); // DOES NOT COMPILE because Date and Time have private constructors; you need to use static methods
like: 
LocalDate d = LocalDate.of(2019, 4, 1);

**
LocalDate.of(2015, Month.JANUARY, 32) // throws DateTimeException ; 32 is out of boundary.
