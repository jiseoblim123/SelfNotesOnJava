First of all, let's clear out the difference between List, ArrayList, and array, and just list.

List, including ArrayList, is used mainly because you can change the size unlike arrays.
arrays are fixed in size and you cannot add or remove elements inside.
list is when you convert array to list like : 
String[] array = {"abc,"def"}; Arrays.asList(array);=
this will return a fixed size list. 
Ithis case if, 
List<String> list = Arrays.asList(array);
then,
array and list will change together since it's pointing to the same data store.

A Cool Trick with Varargs:
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two");
You can have varargs as asList() parameters which lets you convert array to list in one line.
