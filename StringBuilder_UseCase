 StringBuilder is mutable and is used for loops when strings has to be updated constantly.
 For example, if you have to used loops to print say, alphabets by adding each characters from a to z like:
 String alpha = "";
 for (char current = 'A' , current < 'Z', current++){
      alpha += current;
 }
 System.out.println(alpha);
 
 This would be a waste of memory because everytime you update current and assign it to alpha, the previous alpha loses a pointer making it eligible for garbage collection. In this particular case, it will continue to have memory waste until it prints all the alphabets and breaks out of the loop.
 
 StringBuilder is used in this case because StringBuilder is not immutable. 
 Like this:
 
 StringBuilder alpha = "";
 for (char current = 'A', current < 'Z', current++){
      alpha = alpha.append(current);
 }
 System.out.println(alpha);
